Each piece of furniture will require anywhere from 2-10 planks, 2-4 nails and possibly additional items (such as bolts of cloth for a bed, a white candle for lighting, or some steel bars for an organ). Any type of nail can be used, but lower tier nails will bend more often, slowing down construction of the furniture. Any type of plank can be used, assuming the player has the required level, but higher tier planks will award more Contract credits and will award more experience for building the furniture. - Each piece of furniture will require anywhere from 2-10 planks, 2-4 nails and possibly additional items (such as bolts of cloth for a bed, a white candle for lighting, or some steel bars for an organ). - Any type of nail can be used, but lower tier nails will bend more often, slowing down construction of the furniture. - Any type of plank can be used, assuming the player has the required level, but higher tier planks will award more Contract credits and will award more experience for building the furniture."
