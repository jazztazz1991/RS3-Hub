In between stealing from these clans, the player should steal from the other clans that they are able to access in order of descending level requirement, as elven clan workers with a higher Thieving level requirement award more Thieving experience per successful pickpocket. Crystal teleport seeds can be useful for teleporting between districts. It is possible to gain around 373,000 experience an hour by pickpocketing from elven clan workers while wearing a Trahaearn exoskeleton set at level 99 Thieving (with Meilyr and Ithell Clan being affected by the Voice of Seren). The amount of experience that can be gained per hour while pickpocketing elven clan workers depends on which clans are currently affected by the Voice of Seren, as well as the player's ability to access clans which give a greater amount of Thieving experience upon successful pickpocket. A Thieving cape can completely remove the need to bank unless doing Amlodd workers , however it is not required as there are bank chests all over Prifddinas . A good route with level 99 Thieving is to rotate Meilyr , Hefin , Amlodd , Cadarn and Iorwerth workers , as this yields many useful items for Ironman accounts such as doses of super attack , super strength , super defence , super ranging potion , super magic potion , super energy potion , and Signs of the porter IV , as well as various useful Herblore supplies like crushed nest and dragon scale dust . Players may also make use of elf thieving reset tokens , which can be purchased for 200 pilfer points from Dodgy Derek's Dirty Deals in the Thieves' Guild. This will reset the 20 minute timer preventing you from pickpocketing elven clan workers."
