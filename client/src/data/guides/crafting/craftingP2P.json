They function as a potter's wheel, pottery oven, and tannery, offer a 10% increased base experience, and a chance to save clay, leather, and gems when crafting. They can often be found on the dedicated \"Portable Skilling\" server, world 84, near the Lumbridge Market or in Fort Forinthry ."

Molten glass can then be made into several useful items with a glassblowing pipe (tool belt will work). Training this way is a good strategy for going from level 1\u201330 as glasswork offers decent experience rates.",
            "Starting at level 46 Crafting, making orbs via glassblowing is an excellent method of training, granting 52.5 experience per orb and on average around 91,000 with no interruption and possibly up to 120,000 experience per hour. Molten glass can be bought for 225 coins each, and unpowered orbs sell back for 224 coins . Powering orbs is a good way of earning money as the charged orbs fetch much higher prices (air: 811 coins , water: 144 coins , earth: 150 coins , fire: 249 coins ).",
            "At level 54, depending on GE prices, players will likely want to switch to making bomb vials , granting slightly higher XP and much higher GP per hour than orbs, as bomb vials are worth 1,731 coins .",
            "Players who have completed the quest The Hand in the Sand can obtain 84 buckets of sand per day from Bert . Seaweed can either be purchased from the Grand Exchange or from Arhein in Catherby . Players with level 77 Magic who have completed the Lunar Diplomacy quest can use the Superglass Make spell, which can substitute soda ash with raw seaweed or swamp weed as well as producing about 30% more glass for free."

Assuming it takes ~3 minutes to acquire 80,000 and ~1.5 minutes to process bought hides fully, you can expect a rate of up to ~84k base crafting XP per hour.

Level 75 Crafting is required to play the harps, and the Plague's End quest is required to access the city. Playing the harps will yield small amounts of harmonic dust , which is used to craft crystal tools and equipment . Harps will gradually fall out of tune in increments of 10%, granting only half the harmonic dust at 50% and becoming totally unplayable at 100%; the harp can be tuned again at any time, granting 50 construction experience for every 10% tuned."

The red sandstone can then be made into robust glass (there is no requirement for this step as it grants no experience) on a robust glass machine . Players with level 89 Crafting can then blow the glass into potion flasks , granting 100 experience per flask. This is also a good source of money, since each flask sells for 7,537 on the Grand Exchange.",

They are crafted in an identical fashion to regular flasks and give 150 experience each. Crafting Crystal glass or Robust glass requires the completion of the quest As a First Resort . Crafting in Ithell when the Voice of Seren is active will grant 20% more base Crafting XP from crafting crystal flasks. Players with level 115 Dungeoneering can mine an extra 25 per day in the Edimmu resource dungeon . While they offer more experience than regular flasks, they are considerably lower in price at 900 each.",

Players can also make a Reefwalker's cape and a Leviathan ring from koi scales and pearls respectively, each granting 10,000 experience. Note that this experience is gained in the normal way, so things like bonus experience , skill outfits , the wisdom aura , and other such items will increase the experience gained. Both superior and regular gear grant the same experience, and the tradeable armour is also an excellent source of money. Since it has a high XP rate with strictly limited inputs, it is an excellent candidate for double XP events."
