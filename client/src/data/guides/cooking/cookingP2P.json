            "This is a fast but more expensive way to advance the Cooking skill level. Note that the money needed until next step column accounts for the money that will be earned back from selling the cooked fish. Fishing them yourself will give a sizeable amount of fishing experience along with a greater profit because it reduces the cost of ingredients to 0 (minus any cost for lures, e.g. feathers).",
            "Remember that burning a piece of food does not yield experience, so it is always better to plan on having extra money.",
            "A slower, but more reliable way to train cooking is to check out the food chart under the cooking skill page to see what the best food you can cook without burning is, then cook that food. That means there's a certain number of items you must cook, without leaving things to chance or burning. The XP/hour below assumes around 1400 cooks per hour with no bonuses.",
            "At level 85, some players switch to cooking pies with the lunar spell so that they gain experience comparable to shark or better, but also gain Magic experience (at the expense of runes). This requires 65 Magic. As the quest Lunar Diplomacy requires 65 Magic to complete, temporary skill boosts will not work. Lunar spell-cooked pies will never burn.",
            "Training with meat may be done by going to Neitiznot 's yak pen where people leave the meat on the ground. There is a range and bank near to make easily cooking banking and collecting."

At 90 Cooking, you will burn roughly 7% of your sharks  , which still works out at a higher xp/h rate than monkfish and will probably be more profitable. If you're using a Master flameproof aura and cooking gauntlets , you no longer burn sharks at level 90 Cooking. The table above does not account for burning either type of fish."
