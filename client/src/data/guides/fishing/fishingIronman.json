As such, if not supplementing cooking training with methods not reliant on fishing (such as churning butter, events or clan citadel), it's recommended to wait with fishing here until 80 to cook the sharks received here and in other places (this is not necessary with the Bait and Switch relic, which requires 99 ). Note that the rate of raw sailfish, raw green blubber jellyfish, and raw blue blubber jellyfish at this spot is significantly slower than when catching them individually at their own spots, but swarm fishing is very afk. Swarm fishing is also a good way to get sharks, manta rays and sailfish for big game hunter early."
